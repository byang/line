-b::
	Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits.  This can also
	be controlled via the `blame.blankboundary` config option.

--root::
	Do not treat root commits as boundaries.  This can also be
	controlled via the `blame.showroot` config option.

--show-stats::
	Include additional statistics at the end of blame output.

-L <start>,<end>::
	Annotate only the given line range.  <start> and <end> can take
	one of these forms:

	- number
+
If <start> or <end> is a number, it specifies an
absolute line number (lines count from 1).
+

- /regex/
+
This form will use the first line matching the given
POSIX regex.  If <end> is a regex, it will search
starting at the line given by <start>.
+

- +offset or -offset
+
This is only valid for <end> and will specify a number
of lines before or after the line given by <start>.
+

-l::
	Show long rev (Default: off).

-t::
	Show raw timestamp (Default: off).

-S <revs-file>::
	Use revisions from revs-file instead of calling linkgit:git-rev-list[1].

--reverse::
	Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of showing
	the revision in which a line appeared, this shows the last
	revision in which a line has existed. This requires a range of
	revision like START..END where the path to blame exists in
	START.

-p::
--porcelain::
	Show in a format designed for machine consumption.

--incremental::
	Show the result incrementally in a format designed for
	machine consumption.

--encoding=<encoding>::
	Specifies the encoding used to output author names
	and commit summaries. Setting it to `none` makes blame
	output unconverted data. For more information see the
	discussion about encoding in the linkgit:git-log[1]
	manual page.

--contents <file>::
	When <rev> is not specified, the command annotates the
	changes starting backwards from the working tree copy.
	This flag makes the command pretend as if the working
	tree copy has the contents of the named file (specify
	`-` to make the command read from the standard input).

--date <format>::
	The value is one of the following alternatives:
	{relative,local,default,iso,rfc,short}. If --date is not
	provided, the value of the blame.date config variable is
	used. If the blame.date config variable is also not set, the
	iso format is used. For more information, See the discussion
	of the --date option at linkgit:git-log[1].

-M|<num>|::
	Detect moving/copying lines in the file as well.  Instead of
	taking blame for all '+' lines, attempt to find the same
	lines 'in the same file' in the parent commit.  If such a
	match was found, shift the blame to these lines in the
	parent. (This expends extra effort on the order of the size
	of the file for every change.)
+
The net effect is that if code is moved or copied within the file, the
lines are attributed to the original instead of the move/copy.
+
<num> is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
alphanumeric characters that git must detect as moving
within a file for it to associate those lines with the parent
commit. And the default value is 20.

-C|<num>|::
	Like `-M`, detect moving/copying lines between files as well.
	Instead of taking blame for all '+' lines, attempt to find the same
	lines across file boundary according to the number of given `-C`.
	This is useful when you reorganize your program and move/copy
	code around across files. When this option is given once, detect
	lines moved/copied from other files that were modified in the
	same commit. (This expends extra effort on the order of
	<number of modified files>*<file size> for every change.) When this
	option is given twice, the command additionally looks for moves/copies
	from other files in the commit that creates this file. (This expends
	extra effort on the order of <number of files in the commit>*<file size>
	for every change.) When this option is given three times, the
	command additionally looks for moves/copies from other files
	in any commit. (This expends extra effort on the order of
	<commit number>*<number of files in one commit>*<file size>
	for every change.)
+
<num> is optional but it is the lower bound on the number of
alphanumeric characters that git must detect as moving
between files for it to associate those lines with the parent
commit. And the default value is 40. If there are different values
provided by different `-C` option, the last value will take effect finally.

-h::
--help::
	Show help message.
